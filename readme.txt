Re-order categories by switching theirs ID's.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to re-order categories by switching/swapping theirs ID's. Once it's done, the plugin can be uninstalled: it is clean and straighforward. 

If you do it on a long-time running blog and running many plugins, please do a backup of your database. This plugin updates the WPML databases as well, but it might cause troubles for other plugins (please let me know if it is the case and I will support them).

Thanks to Roman <a href='http://www.roman-kaeppeler.de/wordpress/change-category-id'>for his ideas</a> from which this plugin is inspired from :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I donated, can I get rid of the donation button? =
Of course. I don't like to see too many of those buttons neither ;) You can disable the donation buttons from all my plugins by adding this to your wp-config.php:
`define('WP_HIDE_DONATION_BUTTONS', true);`
